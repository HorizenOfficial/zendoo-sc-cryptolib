`zendoo-sc-cryptolib` is a Rust crate that exposes to Java, through JNI, the [ginger-lib](https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ginger-lib) components needed by the [Zendoo](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/123.pdf "Zendoo") sidechain SDK.

In particular it exposes interfaces to:

* handle the finite fields that are the alphabets of the zk Proving Systems
* call the *Poseidon* function, a Snark friendly hashing algorithm
* use a full in-memory *Poseidon-based Merkle Tree*, thus optimized for performance but limited in size (depending on the available RAM)
* manage the *SCTxsCommitmentTree*, as described in section 4.1.3 of the [Zendoo](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/123.pdf "Zendoo") paper
* compute and verify *Schnorr* signatures, handle associated keypairs
* compute and verify a VRF proof, fetch a VRF output, handle associated keypairs (to support *Ouroborous*-style PoS sidechain consensus)
* create and manage *Zendoo* Sidechain proofs

The library includes also an example of a simple Zendoo [sidechain proving circuit](demo-circuit) that can be used to create proofs for backward transfer certificates. This demo circuit can prove that a given certificate was signed by a minimum number of signers, all belonging to a defined set of approved signers. For more info, pls see the specific [document](doc).
The circuit is offered as an example to developers, to help them build their own circuits, that will match their sidechain logic and needs.

**Please note: the code is in development. No guarantees are provided about its security and functionality**

## Release Notes

The current release does not yet serve proof composition.
The proving system has been switched from [Groth16](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/260.pdf) to our Marlin variant [*Coboundary Marlin*](https://github.com/HorizenLabs/marlin).
Support has been introduced to create *Final Darlin* proofs, as per last step of our recursive PCD scheme (See [HGB](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/930) for details), but not yet implemented.

## Build guide

The library compiles on the `stable` Rust toolchain.
To install Rust, just install `rustup` by following the instructions [here](https://rustup.rs/), or via your platform's package manager.

After that, use `cargo`, the standard Rust build tool, to build the library:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/zendoo-sc-cryptolib.git
cd zendoo-sc-cryptolib
cargo build --release
```

This library comes with unit tests for each of the provided crates. Run the tests with:

```bash
cargo test
``` 

More detailed build guide, as well as instructions to build the .jar, can be found in our [build guide](BUILD.md).

## Extras

In order to build and use `SNAPSHOT.jar` package version refer to the following [documentation](./ci/README.md)
